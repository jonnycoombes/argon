This directory contains zip archives with any external (non publicly available) nuget packages
which are hard dependencies for the Argon code base.  

Each zip archive within this directory should be unpacked and then the corresponding packages
added to your local Nuget source (if you don't have one then one should be defined) using a 
command similar to:

dotnet nuget push XXXX.nupkg -s Local

This will force package resolution locally.

At present there are two packages included within here:

1. Glencore Tactical Authentication - package for integration of the the Tempest authentication layer

2. JCS Neon Glow - common support library
